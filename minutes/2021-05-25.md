* HPC
- uploaded key, with the `from="..."` clause
- note: key needs to be re-upload if from clause changes
- `ssh username@jureca.fz-juelich.de` to login to jureca
- `jutil env activate -p cslns` to activate simlab account
- `cd $PROJECT` to go to project folder
- we will have a look at L2L on HPC later

* Installation and configuration
- create an env with name l2l, python 3.9, use channel conda-forge
- `conda create -n l2l python=3.9 -c conda-forge`
- `conda activate l2l`
- `conda deactivate l2l` use only to close the env

* L2L installation
- we found out that ssh keys generated with ed2519 are not supported in github
- we created rsa based key and uploaded at github
- `git clone git@github.com:Meta-optimization/L2L.git`
- switch to neuroevolution branch, `git checkout neuroevolution`
- installed necessary packages, using `python setup.py install` or `pip install -e .`
- got error that's why we switched to:
- `export PYTHONPATH:~/BA/L2L/:~/BA/JUBE/:~/BA/JUBE/bin`
- `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)` needed for netlogo headless

* L2L introduction
- short l2l presentation
- `l2l/optimizees/` see neuroevolution for an example
- `l2l/optimizers/`  evolution contains the genetic algorithm
- `bin/`  run scripts
- for later it may be interesting to try other optimizers as well to compare

* L2L run
- in bin/ run `python l2l-neuroevoltion.py`
- results are stored in `L2L/results`
- see last created folder and then `simulation-work-jobsystem*` for output and error of the run
